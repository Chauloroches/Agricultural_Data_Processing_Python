# Agriculture Data Processing Project
## Project Title
Seasonal Yield and Sales Analysis
Using Python, pandas, and matplotlib/seaborn, we analyzed agricultural data to understand how seasonal crop yields align with sales volumes, helping identify production-to-demand alignment andmarket opportunities.
## Objective
1.Analyze seasonal crop yield trends.
2.Examine seasonal sales volume for crops.
3.Compare yield and sales to identify alignment between production and market demand.
## Tools & Libraries
Python: Main programming language.
pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation.
matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization.
## Datasets
Crop_Production.csv
Columns:
Crop: Crop name (e.g., Maize, Wheat).
Region: Region of production.
Season: Crop-growing season (e.g., Spring, Summer).
Year: Year of data.
Yield_per_Hectare: Yield in tons per hectare.
Sales_Data.csv
Columns:
Crop: Crop name.
Region: Sales region.
Year: Year of data.
Month: Month of sales data.
Sales_Volume: Total sales volume in tons.
Revenue: Total revenue in USD.
## EDA
1.Top crops by yield
2.Monthly trends in sales volume
3.Seasonal trends
## Visualization
1.Plotting Bar chart of average yield per crop
2.Plotting Line chart of Monthly sales
3.Plotting Seasonal Yield Trends
## Insights and Report
1.The crop with the highest yield was Maize and Soybean the lowest
2.The months with the highest sales volumes were months 6 and
